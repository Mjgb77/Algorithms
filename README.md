# README

My personal algorithmic libraries

## Index

* [Graph](./Codes/Graph)
  * [2-SAT](./Codes/Graph/2-SAT.cpp): 
    * 1-based implementation of 2-Satisfiability Problem (positive numbers for positive propositions and negative number for negative propositions.
  * [Connected Components](./Codes/Graph/ConnectedComponnents.cpp)
    * <b>Note</b>: Need to extract necesary code for each of the following subproblems.
    * StronglyConnectedComponents
    * BiconnectedComponents
    * ArticulationPointsAndBridges
  * [Count Number of Minimum Spanning Trees](./Codes/Graph/CountMinimumSpanningTree.cpp)
    * This is uses Count Number of Spanning Trees and "mint"
  * [Count Number of Spanning Trees](./Codes/Graph/CountSpanningTree.cpp)
    * <b>Note</b>: Code is equivalent to building the matrix with addEdge and finding determinant. "mint" is just a ModularInt with the defined operations (/, *, +, -) [note modular division needed]
* Dynamic Programming
* Math
* Trees
* String
* Geometry
