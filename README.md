# README

My personal algorithmic libraries

## Index

* Graph
  * 2-SAT: 
    * 1-based implementation of 2-Satisfiability Problem (positive numbers for positive propositions and negative number for negative propositions.
  * Connected Components
    * <b>Note</b>: Need to extract necesary code for each of the following subproblems.
    * StronglyConnectedComponents
    * BiconnectedComponents
    * ArticulationPointsAndBridges
  * Count Number of Minimum Spanning Trees
    * <b>Note</b>: Code is equivalent to building the matrix with addEdge and finding determinant. "mint" is just a ModularInt with the defined operations (/, *, +, -) [note modular division needed]
* Dynamic Programming
* Math
* Trees
* String
* Geometry
